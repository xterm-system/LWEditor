An simple text editor for bash and linux (not for sh or zsh!)


LWEditor is an open-source text editor for bash and Linux.


Anyone can use it, a programmer, a writer, and in general anyone, and for different purposes.


Quickly correct something in the abstract, edit the text of the speech, write a short story that suddenly came to mind.


With these and many other tasks will help LWEditor!
